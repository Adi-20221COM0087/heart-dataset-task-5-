# heart-dataset-task-5-
In this task, we explored tree-based machine learning models using the Heart Disease dataset to classify the presence or absence of heart disease. A Decision Tree Classifier was trained and visualized using Graphviz, providing insight into how decisions are made based on clinical features such as chest pain type, cholesterol level, and age. To analyze model performance and mitigate overfitting, we also implemented a Random Forest Classifier, which significantly improved accuracy and robustness. Feature importance was analyzed to identify which attributes contributed most to predictions, with ‘cp’, ‘ca’, and ‘thalach’ ranking highest. Finally, cross-validation was performed to evaluate model stability, yielding strong validation accuracy and confirming the reliability of our models.
